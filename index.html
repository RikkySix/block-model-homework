    <div id="first">
        I'm a content and to me width and hight refers by default.
         I'm 200 px width and hight and have blue border and 100px margin
    </div>
    <div id="first">
        I'm same div as one above. See our margins collapsing?
         - we should be 200px far from each other, but we're twice closer
    </div>
    <div id="second">
        This one has all same parametres as abouve, ecxept one
         - it's size is border-oriented
    </div>
    <div id="second">
        Margins shatter as well but that's the way to control box sizing without doing math summarizing attributes. Any questioins? 
    </div>
